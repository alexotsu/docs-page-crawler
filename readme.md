# Page Crawler

I wrote this because I love having [Google Notebook LM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) summarize docs pages for me, but since it cannot crawl pages, I had to add the links one-by-one to the source.

This tool crawls the page for links of the same domain and dumps all the information into a single text doc, which can then be pasted into Notebook LM's context.
